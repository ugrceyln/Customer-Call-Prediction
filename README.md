# Customer-Call-Prediction


Customer representatives in a call center are given a list of numbers to call. This number list also includes information on the date and time that the relevant number should be called. But customer representatives don't have time to call all the numbers. Accordingly, customer representatives want to know whether the customer can pick up the phone or not before making the call.
